[{"content":"The system has been built in C++ using OpenCV 4.9 along with a header-only library for the GUI called cvui 2.7. It utilizes the Viola–Jones algorithm for the facial detection. Additionally, it utilizes the Eigenfaces algorithm for facial recognition. The image processing runs on the CPU.\nFeatures Some of the features currently implemented are:\nDetecting faces. Recognizing registered faces. Information panel for keeping track of currently detected people in the frame. Options for enabling/disabling the webcam and the FPS counter. Adding people to the system. Removing people from the system.

The program also uses pointers for some parts in the program to allow for the editing of bank accounts.\nFeatures Some of the features the system provides are:\nText User Interface for interacting with the system (TUI) User creation (up to 25,000 comfortably). Multi-account creation (up to 25,000 comfortably). Deposit, transfer, and withdraw transactions. Invoice listing all transactions in an account session. Database system for saving all records offline. Password encryption. Prints the foreign rates for a specific currency and an amount.
